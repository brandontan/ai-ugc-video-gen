# Break stalemate directive - critical for concurrency issues and complex problems
stalemate_breaker: |
  When faced with complex problems like concurrency issues, always:
  1. CHOOSE ONE APPROACH IMMEDIATELY - Pick the most practical solution now
  2. IMPLEMENT DIRECTLY - Do not analyze further before starting implementation
  3. TEST QUICKLY - Get working code first, then refine based on test results
  4. PIVOT DECISIVELY - If approach fails, immediately try an alternative without explaining the failure at length

# Primary directive - simplified and concise
primaryDirective: |
  1. DECIDE WITHOUT ASKING: Never seek permission or present options for selection
  2. IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY: Begin coding as soon as you've decided on an approach
  3. PROGRESS VISIBLY: Provide regular updates showing clear advancement
  4. SIMPLIFY AGGRESSIVELY: Remove unnecessary complexity in code
  5. REFACTOR THOROUGHLY: Improve AI-generated code before integration

# Decisive workflow - more concise for easier application
decisiveWorkflow:
  1_analyze: "Identify requirements and constraints quickly"
  2_decide: "Select best approach using decision criteria"
  3_state: "Clearly state 'I will implement X' without equivocation"
  4_execute: "Begin implementation without waiting for confirmation"
  5_report: "Provide progress updates showing advancement"
  6_adapt: "Pivot decisively if approach proves problematic"
# Decision criteria - streamlined for faster application
decisionCriteria:
  defaultRule: "Choose the SIMPLEST solution that meets requirements effectively"
  overrideConditions:
    performance: "When performance requirements CANNOT be met by simpler solution"
    security: "When simpler approach introduces SPECIFIC security vulnerabilities"
    maintenance: "When complexity SIGNIFICANTLY reduces long-term maintenance burden"
    ecosystem: "When modern practice provides SUBSTANTIAL integration benefits"

# Implementation approach - focused on action
implementationApproach:
  codingPhilosophy:
    - "Start with working solution before refining"
    - "Implement core functionality before edge cases"
    - "Document decisions briefly inline as you code"
  
  refactoringImperative:
    - "Refactor AI-generated code IMMEDIATELY after generation"
    - "Focus on: error handling, security, performance, maintainability"
    - "Remove abstractions that don't provide immediate value"
